        Thanks for volunteering some time to take a look at the <strong>IEEE Technology Navigator</strong>, releasing at the end of February to all IEEE members and the general public! <strong>Technology Navigator (TechNav)</strong> is a tool that uses engineering and technology concepts to connect you to the rich and ever-evolving base of IEEE content and events.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the information you need is contained in the overview video and the contextual help, so we wonʼt ask you to read much here.     </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to make the most of your time, weʼve asked you to follow 3 steps to using the TechNav and provide your feedback. This should take about 15 minutes.     </p>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Login with the user name and password included in your invitation email.</li>
        <li>Watch the TechNav overview video.</li>
        <li>Pick one or two of the usage examples provided below and follow them from your perspective and personal expertise. In a limited time, this will be more effective than taking a general “look around the tool”.</li>
        <li>Complete the survey linked from the green button at the bottom left of the TechNav screen.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Example Use Cases</strong>
    </p>
