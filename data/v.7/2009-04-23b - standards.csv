Standard,802.10c - 1998,IEEE Standards for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks: Supplement to Standard for Interoperable LAN/MAN Security (SILS)—Key Management (Clause 3),"To define a standard for services, protocols, data formats, and interfaces that will allow secure IEEE 802 LAN products to interoperate.  IEEE 802.10 has specified three areas for standardization: Secure Data Exchange, Key Management, and Security Management, and the objects necessary to manage each protocol.   The goals of each of these areas of SILS are to be as independent as possible of any particular encryption algorithm, such as DES or RSA, and of the transmission media.  The work in each area is based on the OSI Seven Layer model (IS 7498) and on the OSI Security Architecture (IS 7498/2). The Key Management Standard specifies a Layer 7 protocol that will provide secure automated management of the cryptographic keys to be used by the Secure Data Exchange at Layer 2 or by Security Management at Layer 7.  The standard will draw on work already done for Key Management by other standards groups.  The ANSI X9.E9 group has written a Key Management standard for use by the Banking Community.  ECMA TC32/TG9 has proposed a framework for secure applications, and the Secure Data Network System (SDNS) project has developed a key management standard for use with public key algorithms.  The 802.10 Key Management standard will consider each of these standards to determine if the standard or some form of the standard is appropriate for use with LANs. The appendices to the SILS Key Management standard will provide explanatory information for the standard.  The Rationale for Security Services Appendix will explain why the services that Key Management provides are appropriate for the management of cryptographic keys on LANs and how those services address the threats posed to the security of automated key distribution on LANs.  The Examples of Algorithms Appendix will give an example of the use of Key Management withparticular algorithms.  The Philosophy of Key Management Appendix will provide guidelines on the manual aspects of key management such as the secure distribution of Initialization Keys.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: 802.10c-1998,,C,,Withdrawn,LM,association control service element - ACSE -              ,no

Standard,1212 - 2001,IEEE Standard for a Control and Status Registers (CSR) Architecture for Microcomputer Buses,"This is a full-use standard, a revision of ISO/IEC 13213:1994; its scope reflects accumulated experience with the CSR architecture since it was first promulgated as a standard in 1991. In the intervening years, two bus standards, Scaleable Coherent Interface (SCI), IEEE Std 1596-199x, and Serial Bus, IEEE Std 1394-1995, have been the source of most practical implementation experience. The revised scope of the CSR architecture is given below:  a) The overall architectural framework partitions the total available address space into equal spaces available to individual nodes. A node's address space is in turn partitioned into regions which have different usage models, e.g., memory space, private space for vendor uses, configuration ROM and an I/O space (units space) where transactions may have side effects;  b) A minimal transaction set (read, write and lock requests and their associated completion responses) required for compliant bus standards. Bus bridges compliant with this architecture, whether in a homogeneous or heterogeneous environment, are also expected to transport this transaction set;  c) Fundamental control and status registers (CSRs) are defined to provide a common infrastructure for all compliant buses. In some cases the details of the registers are entirely bus-dependent but the function is common to all compliant buses;  d) Message request and response CSRs are specified to enable directed delivery or broadcast of messages to multiple nodes. The message format permits organizations or vendors to define the meaning of the data payload without the need for a centralized registry of all possible formats; and  e) Configuration ROM provides self-descriptive data structures that permit nodes to uniformly characterize the device services available. This is critical for buses that permit live insertion and removal of nodes; each newly inserted node contains sufficient information for it to be uniquely identified and for the requisite device drivers to be loaded.  Although the original CSR architecture anticipated widespread development of bridges between heterogeneous bus standards and a diversity of addressing modes, both fixed and variable, no such implementations have been made. As a consequence, the most significant changes in scope between the earlier CSR architecture and this standard are the adoption of a single, fixed addressing model and the removal of tutorial material pertaining to the design of bridges.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: 1212-2001,,C,,Withdrawn,MSC,address space              ,no

This standard defines language constructs sufficient to represent the context of a core and of the integration of that core into a system, to facilitate reuse of test data previously developed for that core. The SoC test also requires that the core be embedded in the SoC to allow for efficient testing of the logic external to the core. To that effect, this standard defines constructs that represent the test structures internal to the core for reuse in the creation of the tests for the logic outside the core.

Standard,802.1ah - 2008,IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks -- Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks Amendment 7: Provider Backbone Bridges,"Insert the following text and bullets immediately after bullet z:    To allow scaling of Provider Networks to at least 224 Service Virtual LANs, this standard further specifies  the operation of Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs) by means of an architecture and bridge protocols  compatible and interoperable with Provider Bridged Network protocols and equipment, allowing  interconnection of multiple Provider Bridged Networks. To this end, it    aa) Introduces Backbone Edge Bridges that, by exchanging backbone frames that encapsulate the  addresses, VLAN tags, and data of customer frames, support the virtual, media independent,  equivalent of a number of independent instances of the service provided by media dependent frame  transmission procedures.    ab) Extends the parameters of the Internal Sublayer Service (ISS) and Enhanced Internal Sublayer  Service (EISS) to include a connection identifier, capable of referencing the backbone addresses and  other parameters, used to convey customer frames from one Backbone Edge Bridge (BEB) to all, or  one of, the other BEBs supporting a particular backbone service instance.    ac) Specifies the format of the Backbone Service Instance tag (I-TAG) that encapsulates the customer  addresses, and introduces a Backbone Service Instance Identifier (I-SID) that allows each BEB to  support a number of backbone service instances and permits the unambiguous identification of up to  224 backbone service instances within a single Provider Backbone Bridged Network (PBBN).    ad) Provides a model of Backbone Edge Bridge operation in terms of VLAN-aware bridge components  that allows the use of Provider Bridges as Backbone Core Bridges, with PBBN traffic carried as  frames containing I-TAGs on particular Backbone VLANs (B-VLANs) potentially coexisting with  PBN traffic carried as frames without I-TAGs on other Backbone VLANs.    ae) Specifies the interfaces that a Provider Backbone Bridged Network can provide to transport service frames. These comprise a Port-based service interface that assigns all received untagged and  priority-tagged frames to a single S-VLAN transported over a single backbone service instance, an  S-tagged service interface capable of mapping individual S-VLANs to different backbone service  instances, and an I-tagged service interface capable of mapping frames from one set of backbone  service instances to another.    af) Describes the use of redundant bridges and access LANs to protect backbone service access against failure of any of those systems or components.    ag) Specifies the management of Backbone Edge Bridges in terms of the model of operation [item ad)  above], making use of defined management objects for the individual VLAN-aware bridge  components, and adding managed objects to facilitate service creation.    ah) Describes the use of connectivity fault management (CFM) to detect and isolate faults in the  connectivity provided to individual S-VLANs across the PBBN, in the connectivity provided to the  group of S-VLANs supported by a single backbone service instance (identified by an I-SID), and in  the connectivity provided to individual B-VLANs within the backbone itself.    ai) Specifies extensions to the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) to allow network  administrators to protect against loops through peered PBBNs without requiring coupling of  spanning trees that operate independently for each PBBN.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: 802.1ah-2008,,C,,Published,LM,"802.1ah-2008, Bridged Local Area Networks, LANs, local area networks, MAC Bridges, MANs, metropolitan area networks, MRP, MSTP, Multiple Registration Protocol, Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol, Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol, MVRP, Provider Bridged Local Area Networks, Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks, virtual LANs              ",yes

Standard,62525 - 2007,IEEE StandardTest Interface Language (STIL) for DigitalTest Vector Data,"This standard defines a test description language that:  a) Facilitates the transfer of large volumes of digital test vector data from CAE environments to automated  test equipment (ATE) environments;  b) Specifies pattern, format, and timing information sufficient to define the application of digital test  vectors to a device under test (DUT);  c) Supports the volume of test vector data generated from structured tests such as scan/automatic test  pattern generation (ATPG), integral test techniques such as built-in self test (BIST), and functional  test specifications for IC designs and their assemblies, in a format optimized for application in ATE  environments.  In setting the scope for any standard, some issues are defined to not be pertinent to the initial project. The  following is a partial list of issues that were dropped from the scope of this initial project:  — Levels: A key aspect of a digital test program is the ability to establish voltage and current parameters  (levels) for signals under test. Level handling is not explicitly defined in the current standard, as  this information is both compact (not presenting a transportation issue) and commonly established  independently of digital test data, requiring different support mechanisms outside the current scope  of this standard. Termination values may affect levels.  — Diagnostic/fault-tracing information: The goal of this standard is to optimally present data that needs  to be moved onto ATE. While diagnostic data, fault identification data, and macro/design element  correspondence data can fall into this category (and is often fairly large), this standard is also  focused on integrated circuit and assemblies test, and most debug/failure analysis occurs separately  from the ATE for these structures. Note that return of failure information (for off-ATE analysis) is  also not part of the standard as currently defined.  — Datalogging mechanisms, formatting, and control usually are not defined as part of this current  standard.  — Parametric tests are not defined as an integral part of this standard, except for optional pattern labels  that identify potential locations for parametric tests, such as IDDQ tests or alternating current (AC)  timing tests.  — Program flow: Test sequencing and ordering are not defined as part of the current standard except as  necessary to define collections of digital patterns meant to execute as a unit.  — Binning constructs are not part of the current standard.  — Analog or mixed-signal test: While this is an area of concern for many participants, at this point  transfer of analog test data does not contribute to the same transportation issue seen with digital data.  — Algorithmic pattern constructs (such as sequences commonly used for memory test) are not currently  defined as part of the standard.  — Parallel test/multisite test constructs are not an integral part of the current environment.  — User input and user control/options are not part of the current standard.  — Characterization tools, such as shmoo plots, are not defined as part of the current standard.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: 62525-2007,,C,,Published,TT,"automatic test pattern generator (ATPG), built-in self-test (BIST), computer-aided engineering  (CAE), cyclize, device under test (DUT), digital test vectors, event, functional vectors, pattern, scan vectors, signal, structural vectors, timed event, waveform, waveshape                ",yes

Standard,1028 - 2008,IEEE Standard for Software Reviews and Audits,"This standard provides minimum acceptable requirements for systematic software reviews, where  “systematic” includes the following attributes:    -- Team participation  -- Documented results of the review  -- Documented procedures for conducting the review    Reviews that do not meet the requirements of this standard are considered to be non-systematic reviews.  The standard is not intended to discourage or prohibit the use of non-systematic reviews.    The definitions, requirements, and procedures for the following five types of reviews are included within  this standard:    a) Management reviews  b) Technical reviews  c) Inspections  d) Walk-throughs  e) Audits    This standard does not establish the need to conduct specific reviews; that need is defined by other software  engineering standards or by local procedures. This standard provides definitions, requirements, and  procedures that are applicable to the reviews of software development products throughout the software life  cycle. Users of this standard shall specify where and when this standard applies and any intended  deviations from this standard.    This standard may be used with other software engineering standards that determine the products to be  reviewed, the timing of reviews, and the necessity of reviews.

A useful model is to consider IEEE Std 1028-2008  as a subroutine to the other standards. Thus, if IEEE Std 1012-2004 [B6] were used to carry out the  verification and validation process, the procedure in IEEE Std 1012-2004 [B6] could be followed until such  time as instructions to carry out a specific review are encountered. At that point, IEEE Std 1028-2008 would  be “called” to carry out the review, using the specific review type described herein. Once the review has been  completed, IEEE Std 1012-2004 [B6] would be “returned to” for disposition of the results of the review and  any additional action required by IEEE Std 1012-2004 [B6].    This standard may also be used as a stand-alone definition of software review and audit procedures. In this  case, local management must determine the events that precede and follow the actual software reviews and  audits.    In this model, requirements and quality attributes for the software product are “parameter inputs” to the  review and are imposed by the “caller.” When the review is finished, the review outputs are “returned” to  the “caller” for action.

Standard,139 - 1988,"IEEE Recommended Practice for the Measurement of Radio Frequency Emission from Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) Equipment Installed on User's Premises","This document describes equipment inspection and radio frequency (rf) electromagnetic field measurement procedures for evaluation of rf industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment installed in the user's facility. The term, “ISM equipment,” as used here, includes equipment that generates rf energy for purposes other than radio communications, to cause physical, chemical, or biological changes; for example, industrial heaters (dielectric and induction), medical diathermy, ultrasonic equipment, rf plasma devices, and rf stabilized welders. These procedures are designed to help ensure that the equipment does not interfere with radio communications, navigation, and other essential radio services. The engineer responsible for the measurements should take all reasonable precautions to ensure that the maximum emission from the ISM equipment under test (EUT) has been measured.  Radio frequency field-strength measurements of installed ISM equipment may be required if any of the following conditions exist:  1) The emission from the EUT was not measured by the manufacturer.  2) Because of its size or special operating conditions, the EUT could not be tested before installation.  3) Installed ISM equipment is suspected of causing interference.  4) ISM equipment has been modified in a way that could affect its rf emissions.  5) As the equipment ages, there is a question about its continued compliance.  6) There is a question about the safety to nearby personnel because of the emissions from the equipment.  Measurements should be made under the direction of an engineer skilled in making and interpreting rf field-strength measurements. These measurements are made after the equipment is installed and ready for use at its place of use, and after it has been inspected as described in 2.2. The measurement report should generally be kept on file for at least three years after new measurements are made or after the equipment is no longer in use. There are significant differences between the “open field” or anechoic chamber measurements common in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) work and the on-site measurements of installed ISM equipment. Some of these differences are described below.  1) The measurement conditions are usually more difficult because of crowded measurement locations,  reflections from surrounding walls and equipment, and signals from other sources.  2  2) It is reasonable to take advantage of the shielding provided by walls and other equipment located between the ISM Equipment Under Test (EUT) and the location at which field-strength information is required. While the effect of a single wall may be small, the total effect of other equipment and building structures may be significant. In any case, it is not necessary to make measurements in a way which eliminates the benefits of this shielding. Some equipment is designed to be operated in a shielded enclosure, either because of its own sensitivity to outside interference, or because of its emission characteristics. When measuring the emission from this equipment, take advantage of the attenuation of the enclosure by making the measurements outside  the enclosure, with the equipment in its normal operating position.   3) Since the measurement equipment is disconnected, moved, and reconnected many times during a set of measurements, its calibration should be checked frequently.  4) ISM equipment may often be grouped for field-strength measurements, taking one set of measurements for the entire group.  5) Electromagnetic-emission measurements of installed ISM equipment are usually significantly less accurate than laboratory (open field or test chamber) measurements because of lack of control of the measurement environment. The engineer responsible for the measurements should ensure, to the extent practical, that significant inaccuracies do not creep into the measurements from controllable factors. The overall accuracy of the measurements should be taken into account when reporting the results.  6) On-site measurements of installed ISM equipment are usually unique to the particular site because of effects of local shielding. However, they may apply to the same piece of equipment or to identical equipment installed at other sites that provide equivalent shielding and grounding.  7) The emission measured from the ISM equipment is a function of the environment surrounding the equipment. In most industrial locations, the environment is likely to change. Therefore, when measuring emission,   1) make sure the environment is typical of its usual operating condition, and, 2) determine, to the extent possible, if probable environment changes will increase emission. If so, the user should be warned. When measuring emission because of suspected electromagnetic interference, the conditions existing at the time of the suspected interference should be duplicated as closely as possible.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: 139-1988,,EMC,,Published,SDCom,"  digital handsfree telephone  electroacoustic transmission characteristics  handsfree telephone  voice switching characteristics  voice transmission characteristics""  ""         ",yes

Standard,551 - 2006,Recommended Practice for Calculating AC Short-Circuit Currents in Industrial and Commercial Power Systems,"Electric power systems in industrial plants and commercial and institutional buildings are  designed to serve loads in a safe and reliable manner. One of the major considerations in  the design of a power system is adequate control of short circuits or faults as they are  commonly called. Uncontrolled short-circuits can cause service outage with  accompanying production downtime and associated inconvenience, interruption of  essential facilities or vital services, extensive equipment damage, personnel injury or  fatality, and possible fire damage.  Short-circuits are caused by faults in the insulation of a circuit, and in many cases an arc  ensues at the point of the fault. Such an arc may be destructive and may constitute a fire  hazard. Prolonged duration of arcs, in addition to the heat released, may result in transient  overvoltages that may endanger the insulation of equipment in other parts of the system.  Clearly, the fault must be quickly removed from the power system, and this is the job of  the circuit protective devices—the circuit breakers and fusible switches.  A short-circuit current generates heat that is proportional to the square of the current  magnitude, I2R. The large amount of heat generated by a short-circuit current may damage  the insulation of rotating machinery and apparatus that is connected into the faulted  system, including cables, transformers, switches, and circuit breakers. The most  immediate danger involved in the heat generated by short-circuit currents is permanent  destruction of insulation. This may be followed by actual fusion of the conducting circuit,  with resultant additional arcing faults.  The heat that is generated by high short-circuit currents tends not only to impair insulating  materials to the point of permanent destruction, but also exerts harmful effects upon the  contact members in interrupting devices.  The small area common between two contact members that are in engagement depends  mainly upon the hardness of the contact material and upon the amount of pressure by  which they are kept in engagement. Owing to the concentration of the flow of current at  the points of contact engagement, the temperatures of these points reached at the times of  peak current are very high. As a result of these high spot temperatures, the material of  which the contact members are made may soften. If, however, the contact material is  caused to melt by excessive I2R losses, there is an imminent danger of welding the  contacts together rendering it impossible to separate the contact members when the switch  or circuit breaker is called upon to open the circuit. Since it requires very little time to  establish thermal equilibrium at the small points of contact engagement, the temperature at  these points depends more upon the peak current than upon the rms current. If the peak  current is sufficient to cause the contact material to melt, resolidification may occur  immediately upon decrease of the current from its peak value.  Other important effects of short-circuit currents are the strong electromagnetic forces of  attraction and repulsion to which the conductors are subjected when short-circuit currents  are present. These forces are proportional to the square of the current and may subject any  rotating machinery, transmission, and switching equipment to severe mechanical stresses  and strains. The strong electromagnetic forces that high short-circuit currents exert upon  equipment can cause deformation in rotational machines, transformer windings, and  equipment bus bars, which may fail at a future time.

Standard,493 - 2007,IEEE Recommended Practice for the Design of Reliable Industrial and Commercial Power Systems,The objective of this book is to present the fundamentals of reliability analysis applied to  the planning and design of industrial and commercial electric power distribution systems.  The intended audience for this material is primarily consulting engineers and plant electrical engineers and technicians.   The design of reliable industrial and commercial power distribution systems is important  because of the high cost associated with power outages. It is necessary to consider the cost  of power outages when making design decisions for new power distribution systems as well as to have the ability to make quantitative “cost-versus-reliability” trade-off studies.  The lack of credible data concerning equipment reliability and the cost of power outages  has hindered engineers in making such studies. This revision of IEEE Std 493™ overcomes these obstacles.  The authors of this book have attempted to provide sufficient information so that  reliability analyses can be performed on industrial and commercial power systems without  requiring cross-references to other texts.

This mechanical/electrical interface is intended to serve government/commercial interest for applications in test, system integration, manufacturing, monitoring, and other functional requirements that demand large contact densities and quick-disconnect mechanical operation. A joint technical forum has been operational since 1997 under the auspices of the IEEE Std 1505 RFI Working Group and a recently formed industry/government Common Test Interface (CTI) Working Group.  Readers of this document are encouraged to comment on details unclear, contradictory, or undefined to the IEEE 1505 RFI Working Group or the IEEE Standards Association for review and change. These organizations can be contacted at the locations described in the preface of this document.  As IEEE Std 1505 evolves, additional revisions may be required and reballoted by the IEEE Standards  Association.

Standard,1588 - 2008,IEEE Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems,"This standard defines a protocol enabling precise synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such as network communication, local computing, and distributed objects. The protocol is applicable to systems communicating by local area networks supporting multicast messaging including, but not limited to, Ethernet. The protocol enables heterogeneous systems that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize to a grandmaster clock. The protocol supports system-wide synchronization accuracy in the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local clock computing resources. The default behavior of the protocol allows simple systems to be installed and operated without requiring the administrative attention of users. The standard includes mappings to User Datagram Protocol (UDP)/Internet Protocol (IP), DeviceNet, and a layer-2 Ethernet implementation. It includes formal mechanisms for message extensions, higher sampling rates, correction for asymmetry, a clock type to reduce error accumulation in large topologies, and specifications on how to incorporate the resulting additional data into the synchronization protocol. The standard permits synchronization accuracies better than 1 ns. The protocol has features to address applications where redundancy and security are a requirement. The standard defines conformance and management capability. There is provision to support unicast as well as multicast messaging. The standard includes an annex on recommended practices.

Standard,N42.43 - 2006,American National Standard Performance Criteria for Mobile and Transportable Radiation Monitors Used for Homeland Security,"This standard specifies the operational and performance requirements for transportable and/or mobile  radiation monitors used in homeland security applications. Transportable radiation monitors are designed to be transported to a location and used for a specific task or for a specified period of time; they do not require permanent mounting platforms. Transportable monitors may be mounted to a vehicle such as a trailer, and are only used when the vehicle is stationary. Mobile monitors are those systems that are typically in operation on a platform that is in motion but that can also be used while stationary. These monitors may be mounted in vehicles, including water craft, towed systems, or those monitors mounted to cranes. Mobile monitors can also be those that are used while being carried by a person such as a backpack.  Operational requirements established by this standard include radiation detection and radionuclide  identification (if used), and those requirements associated with the expected electrical, mechanical, and environmental conditions while in transit and when deployed.  The tests described in this standard provide a means to ensure that a monitor meets the requirements stated. Successful completion of the radiation tests described in this standard should not be construed as an ability to successfully detect and identify all radionuclides in all environments.  Other than backpack units, this standard does not cover instruments that are hand-carried during use, or those instruments addressed by ANSI N42.32, ANSI N42.33, ANSI N42.34, ANSI N42.35, and ANSI  N42.38.1  This standard addresses instruments used within the United States, but can be used as a basis for use elsewhere.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: N42.43-2006,,NPS,,Published,N42,"mobile radiation monitors, transportable radiation monitors  capacitor switching  high-voltage circuit breakers  indoor drawout  line closing  load current switching  outdoor  pollution level creepage distance  power frequency  rated maximum voltage  short-circuit  TRV  tra""  ""  ",yes
Standard,N42.41 - 2007,American National Standard  Minimum Performance Criteria for Active Interrogation Systems Used for Homeland Security,"This standard specifies the operational and performance requirements for active interrogation systems for  use in homeland security applications. These systems employ penetrating ionizing radiation (e.g., neutrons,  high-energy x-rays, gamma-rays) to detect and identify hidden chemical, nuclear, and explosive agents by  detection of stimulated secondary radiations or by nuclear resonance contrast, giving elemental and/or  nuclidic identification of the composition of the substances-of-interest. These inspection systems may be  designed for open inspection zones of various sizes or for various sizes of containers such as small  packages, briefcases, suitcases, air cargo containers, passenger vehicles, two-axle trucks, intermodal cargo  containers, semi-trailers/tractor rigs, or rail cars. The systems may be designed for operation in indoor,  outdoor, or mobile facilities.  At the time of this writing, there are only a few commercially available active interrogation systems, and  most of these are still in a stage of rapid development. None are yet deployed on a very broad scale, either  domestically or internationally. The requirements of this standard provide a set of minimally acceptable  performance criteria for preliminary screening of candidate systems for further consideration. Prior to  deployment on a broad scale, more detailed and realistic testing beyond the scope of this standard should be  carried out, with some test specifications outside of the public domain. Detectable amounts of substances in  this standard may correspond to quantities that are larger or smaller than those of significance in particular  circumstances. Successful completion of the tests described in this standard should not be construed as  certification of an ability to successfully detect and identify all chemical, nuclear, and explosive agents in  all possible cargos, nor as a certification that false positive rates in actual stream-of-commerce applications  will be no larger than in these tests.  This standard does not consider radiographic imaging characteristics. However, if active interrogation  features that provide chemical or nuclidic identification of substances are included in a system that is  primarily intended for radiography, then the active interrogation features of the system may be tested and  evaluated under this standard.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: N42.41-2007,,NPS,,Published,N42,"N42.41-2007, active interrogation, baggage, cargo, chemical warfare agents, detection, explosives, gamma-rays, high-energy X-rays, homeland security, identification, neutrons, SNM, special nuclear materials, weapons of mass destruction, WMD              ",yes
Standard,N42.48 - 2008,American National Standard Performance Requirements for Spectroscopic Personal Radiation Detectors (SPRDs) for Homeland Security,"This standard describes design and performance requirements along with testing methods for evaluating radiation detection instruments that are pocket-sized and worn on the body for the purpose of rapid detection and identification of radioactive materials.    The performance requirements contained in this standard are meant to provide a means for verifying the capability of these instruments to reliably detect changes above background levels of radiation, notify the user to these changes, and provide a means to determine if the alarm was caused by a radionuclide of interest that may require further evaluation.    These devices are not primarily intended to provide a measurement of dose-equivalent rate. However, their indication can provide an approximate value of exposure rate that should be reasonably accurate. They are also not meant to provide radionuclide identification at the same level as radionuclide identification detectors defined in ANSI N42.34.1    Successful completion of the tests described in this standard should not be construed as an ability to identify all radionuclides in all environments.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: N42.48-2008,,NPS,,Published,N42,"N42.48-2008, alarm, design criteria, exposure rate, performance specifications, personal radiation  detectors, pocket-sized, radiation, radiation detection, radiation instrumentation, spectroscopic              ",yes

The standard applies to systems that are the following:    -- Single or multiple energy, source, or view  -- Employ primary (i.e., transmission) and/or scatter (e.g., backscatter) radiation detection  -- Used to detect prohibited and controlled materials and/or to verify manifests  -- Primarily imaging systems but also may have complementary features such as material discrimination and automatic active or passive threat alerts. This standard does not address how to test these complementary features.    Adherence to all applicable mechanical and electrical safety requirements and compatibility with all applicable installation codes, including electro-magnetic compatibility requirements, is extremely important for any type of x-ray or gamma-ray screening system; however, identification of these requirements is not within the scope of this standard.

Standard,421.2 - 1990,"IEEE Guide for Identification, Testing, and Evaluation of the Dynamic Performance of Excitation Control Systems","This guide includes criteria, definitions, and test objectives for evaluating the dynamic performance of excitation  control systems as applied by electric utilities. The term “excitation control system” (see Fig 1) is used to distinguish  the combined performance of the synchronous machine, power system, and excitation system from that of the  excitation system alone (see IEEE Std 100-1988, IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms  (ANSI) [1]1 and IEEE Std 421.1-1986, IEEE Standard Definitions for Excitation Systems for Synchronous Machines  (ANSI) [2]). The primary purpose of this guide is to provide a basis for evaluating closed-loop performance of  excitation control systems for both large and small signal disturbances; confirming the adequacy of mathematical  models of excitation control systems for use in analytical studies of power systems; identifying objectives for tests of  excitation control systems and their components; and preparing excitation system specifications and additional  standards. Portions of this guide will also serve as educational material for people who are becoming acquainted with  excitation control systems.  Traditionally, large signal performance (see 2.1) has been more closely associated with equipment specification and  acceptance testing, while small signal performance (see 2.2) has been more closely associated with stability and model  studies. Matching actual disturbance data with model simulations requires that both large and small signal  performance criteria be considered during design specification and acceptance testing.",http://standards.ieee.org/cgi-bin/status?Designation: 421.2-1990,,PE,,Published,ED&PG,"Small signal disturbances, Large signal disturbances, Excitation system specification, Excitation control systems, Closed loop performance              ",yes

Standard,421.5 - 2005,IEEE Recommended Practice for Excitation System Models for Power System Stability Studies,"When the behavior of synchronous machines is to be simulated accurately in power system stability studies,it is essential that the excitation systems of the synchronous machines be modeled in sufficient detail (see Byerly and Kimbark [B7]1). The desired models must be suitable for representing the actual excitation equipment performance for large, severe disturbances as well as for small perturbations.   A 1968 IEEE Committee Report (see [B18]) provided initial excitation system reference models. It  established a common nomenclature, presented mathematical models for excitation systems then in common use, and defined parameters for those models. A 1981 report (see IEEE Committee Report [B20]) extended that work. It provided models for newer types of excitation equipment not covered previously as well as improved models for older equipment.  This document, based heavily on the 1981 report, is intended to again update the models, provide models for additional control features, and formalize those models in a recommended practice. To some extent, the model structures presented in this document are intended to facilitate the use of field test data as a means of obtaining model parameters. The models are, however, reduced order models, and they do not represent all of the control loops on any particular system. In some cases, the model used may represent a substantial reduction, resulting in large differences between the structure of the model and the physical system.  The excitation system models themselves do not allow for regulator modulation as a function of system frequency, an inherent characteristic of some older excitation systems. The models are valid for frequency deviations of ±5% from rated frequency and oscillation frequencies up to about 3 Hz. These models would not normally be adequate for use in studies of subsynchronous resonance or other shaft torsional interaction problems. Delayed protective and control functions that may come into play in long-term dynamic performance studies are not represented. See additional information in Annex F.  Where possible, the supplied models are referenced to commercial equipment and vendor names shown in  Annex I. This information is given for the convenience of users of this recommended practice and does not constitute an endorsement by the IEEE of these products. The models thus referenced may be appropriate for equivalent excitation systems supplied by other manufacturers. A sample set of data (not necessarily typical) for each of the models, for at least one particular application, is  provided in Annex H. A suffix “A” is used for the designation of models introduced or modified in IEEE Std 421.5-1992, and a suffix “B” is used for models introduced or modified in this latest recommended practice,IEEE Std 421.5-2005.

Standard,738 - 2006,IEEE Standard for Calculating the Current-Temperature of Bare Overhead Conductors,"The purpose of this standard is to present a method of calculating the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead conductors. Conductor surface temperatures are a function of the following:  a) Conductor material properties  b) Conductor diameter  c) Conductor surface conditions  d) Ambient weather conditions  e) Conductor electrical current  The first two of these properties are specific chemical and physical properties. The third may vary with time and be dependent upon ambient atmospheric conditions other than weather. The fourth, weather, varies greatly with the hour and season. The fifth, conductor electrical current, may be constant or may vary with power system loading, generation dispatch, and other factors.  The equations relating electrical current to conductor temperature may be used in either of the following two ways:  — To calculate the conductor temperature when the electrical current is known  — To calculate the current that yields a given maximum allowable conductor temperature  For the purposes of this standard, either the electrical current is assumed constant for all time or it is assumed to undergo a step change from an initial current to a final current. The ambient weather conditions are assumed to be constant with time in both the steady-state and transient calculation methods described in this standard.  This standard includes mathematical methods and indicates sources of the values to be used in the calculation of conductor temperatures and conductor thermal ratings. However, because there is a great diversity of weather conditions and operating circumstances for which conductor temperatures and/or thermal ratings must be calculated, the standard does not undertake to list actual temperature-current relationships for specific conductors or weather conditions. Each user must make their own assessment of which weather data and conductor characteristics best pertain to their area or particular transmission line.

When the device's breakdown voltage is exceeded, its normal high impedance state changes to a low impedance state to allow conduction of the surge discharge current. After the device conducts the surge discharge current, it interrupts the flow of system follow current and returns to its high impedance state. I the event of continuing current not representing normal system conditions, the device continues to provide a low impedance pass until an external bypass mechanism activates, the source of undesired current is de-energized, or a coordinated protective current element operates.  This standard's test criteria and definitions provide a common engineering language beneficial to user and manufacturer of air gap surge protective devices. 1.4 Due to the voltage and energy levels employed in the majority of tests contained herein , all measurements should be considered dangerous and appropriate caution should be taken in their performance.

The standards are organized to be of use to several  audiences:  a) Those interested in an introduction to the MMS and its capabilities will find this standard, IEEE Std  1244.1-2000, to be a reasonable, though technical, introduction to the system.  b) Those interested in implementing applications that utilize the MMS will find this standard, IEEE Std  1244.1-2000, and IEEE Std 1244.3-2000  1  to be helpful.  c) Those interested in implementing devices such as robotic libraries or drives will find IEEE Std  1244.1-2000, IEEE P1244.2/D041900, IEEE Std 1244.4-2000, and IEEE Std 1244.5-2000, to be  essential.  d) Those interested in implementing the entire MMS will find all standards in the IEEE MMS suite of  standards to be required reading.  A suite of IEEE 1244 standards describes the MMS. This modular approach to standardizing an MMS per-mits a granularity of conformance not possible otherwise, and allows a degree of independent evolution for the components of an IEEE MMS. Nevertheless, the overall architecture of the IEEE MMS is described in IEEE 1244.1-2000, and fundamental information (including the data model) that is common to all related standards is communicated through that standard. Reference to the MMS Architecture is crucial in under¬standing the MMS, its associated standards, and the components of an MMS implementation. The set of standards that comprise the IEEE MMS suite are listed in Table 1.

(Feel free, for example, to skim or skip ahead of the Definitions clause, Clause 3 in this standard, as you read.)     The authors of the IEEE 1244 standards expect that additional publications that document aspects of the MMS will appear over time. It is intended that the IEEE MMS suite of standards be considered the definitive reference to the standard, and that these additional publications exist to explain, clarify, and amplify the IEEE standards, aspects of implementation, or of management of MMS sites.     It is expected that vendors will implement proprietary products that add value to systems that are based on the IEEE MMS. These proprietary products must not change the required aspects of the standard as addressed in the IEEE standards. These products may significantly improve the functionality and usability of a standards-based system. Over time, such proprietary extensions may be proposed as additions to the IEEE standard. Until such time as an extension is transformed into an approved IEEE standard, it must not be referred to as a standard.

Standard,1244.2,"Standard for Media Management System (MMS) Session Security, Authentication, Initialization Protocol (SSAIP)","The IEEE Session Security, Authentication, and Initialization Protocol (SSAIP) is used by the IEEE Media Manager (MM) when a Media Management System (MMS) Client or an MMS Module wishes to connect to the MM.     The SSAIP provides identification, and if desired authentication, of the client, which is a requirement to obtain access to the services of the MM in compliance with the MMS security model. The SSAIP also establishes parameters of the communications between the MMS Client and the MMS Module thereafter, such as language and language type.     This standard describes the syntax and semantics of the protocol messages that pass between the MMS client or MMS module and the MM. Since this protocol is only used in the context of the MMS, this standard cannot be understood without a thorough understanding of its architecture as described in IEEE Std 1244.1-2000. In addition, the protocols that are implemented on top of the SSAIP protocol are described in IEEE Std 1244.3-2000, IEEE Std 1244.4-2000, IEEE Std 1244.5-2000, IEEE P1244.6, and IEEE P1244.7.     The actual security features of the SSAIP rely upon SSL3, X.509, and assume the default (but not mandated) use of SHA within the X.509 certificates. The SSAIP provides for the optional use of SSL, to achieve privacy of communications, when such privacy is desired or necessary. The SSAIP allows for various levels of authentication of the parties involved in the communication, ranging from none, to the use of passwords, to the use of X.509 certificates. This means it is possible with this proposal to have no privacy and no authentication, privacy without any authentication, highly assured authentication and no privacy, etc. Note that the assurance of using X.509 certificates and SHA or similar signatures for authentication remains secure, i.e., the authentication cannot be compromised, without the use of SSL. Not using SSL simply means that the communication may not remain private. Also note that the use of passwords together with SSL is secure,the only weakness in this approach is the setting up of the passwords in the first place, a process which is outside the scope of this standard.     Some typical applications, where security considerations may be found to differ, may be as follows:     a) Home office: Isolated machine or machines using automated backup to a very small CD-RW or 8 mm library, requiring no privacy and no authentication. A vendor of such a facility can still be MMS-standards compliant.   b) Typical in-house business: With checked authentication of the client (to safeguard against careless accidents), but no server authentication and no privacy (U.S. law comes close to guaranteeing lack of privacy in the work situation).   c) DOD classified site: High-assurance authentication of the client is required in order to enforce “need to know,” but little or no authentication of the server is needed, nor is privacy needed, because the network is physically protected.   d) Business-to-business over the public Internet: Privacy is needed, as well as highly assured authentication of the client to the server, and the server to the client.

Standard,1244.3,Standard for Media Management System (MMS) Media Management Protocol (MMP),"The IEEE Media Management Protocol (MMP) is used when an MMS application requests the services of the MM, including the following:   a) Access to media   b) Device management functions   c) Routine operational functions   d) MMS administration   This protocol specifies the syntax and the semantics associated with various commands and protocol messages that pass between an MMS application and the MM. In addition, this standard defines certain aspects of the operation of the MM itself in response to various events that occur in the MMS, for example, the initiation and termination of various components of the MMS.     Since this protocol is only used in the context of the MMS, this standard cannot be understood without a thorough understanding of its architecture and the underlying Data Model as described in IEEE Std 1244.1-2000.     This standard does not dictate or favor any particular implementation scheme for the MM. It is a standard for those interested in implementing applications that utilize the services of the MM. For example, the protocol requires that the MM employ a persistent store to keep track of various pieces of information. However, this specification does not imply any particular structure of the store. An MM implementation shall record errors and conditions that occur during the operation of the MMS. To achieve this, the Data Model defines a specific table, called the MESSAGE table. An MM implementation could provide additional logging capabilities that are beyond those defined by this standard.
